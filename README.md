# Dungeon Delvers 3.0


Our application is a booking website where users can signup, login, and create events and bookings as well as search for them. This application is made with MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js, and GraphQL.

# Usuage

To use this application, simply create a username and password and signup. Then you are free to sign in and view booked events as well as make some.

# Installation

GitRepo URL: https://github.com/Aswebilius/supreme-booking

First, clone the repository. Then install the following dependencies by typing "npm i" and the name of the dependency. The dependencies needed in the root folder are as follows: bcrypt, body-parser, dataloader, dotenv, express, express-graphql, graphql, jsonwebtoken, mongoose, and nodemon. In the frontend folder the following dependencies needed are: react, react-scripts, react-dom-router, react-dom, and chartjs. Again, all of these are installed with "npm i (name of dependency).

To start the application, in the root folder open an integrated terminal and type "npm start." Then in the frontend folder open an integrated terminal and type again "npm start". You can now enjoy testing this MERN stack app.

# Challenges

Heroku has been the biggest issue as it does not play nice with graphiql which was used to populate the database. 

This app is a barebones MVP as we would like to add additional functionality but, are short on time. This is our third attempt on completing the group project 3 challenge and are out of time. 

A lack of experience and much more needed practice would definitely help us to develop a much better app. 

# Future Development

Adding more specialized features and allow users to post photos of their events and bookings is one feature we would like to include in the future.
